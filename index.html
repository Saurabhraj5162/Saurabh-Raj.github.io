            </h2>
            <p>
              Greetings! I'm Saurabh Raj, an AI/ML Practitioner with a dynamic
              journey through the realms of technology and innovation. Armed
              with an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from City, University of
              London and a B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from the prestigious
              Indian Institute of Technology, Jammu, my passion for harnessing
              the power of AI knows no bounds.
            </p>

            <p>
              My trajectory led me to create, innovate, and solve at Lumera,
              London, where I currently craft a groundbreaking Code Generator
              Language Model. This innovation reimagines problem-solving by
              transforming questions into code solutions, woven together with
              PyTorch, LLM, NLP, Javascript, and HuggingFace's brilliance.
            </p>

            <p>
              Previously, at Accenture AI, Gurugram, I honed my expertise as a
              Data Engineer. I navigated intricate data landscapes,
              orchestrating transformations and engineering features from
              diverse market sources. SQL, Apache Spark, Scala, and Azure's Big
              Data platform fueled my journey, alongside a vibrant toolkit of
              Kafka, Airflow, and Hadoop.
            </p>

            <p>
              My footprint extends further to Truminds Software Sys, where I
              thrived as a Software Engineer AI/ML. I orchestrated image
              classification, object detection, and harnessed NoSQL databases to
              create a robust vigilance system. My time as a Data Science Intern
              further enriched my toolkit with NLP techniques and AWS Lex,
              amplifying my capability to create a CRM recommendation chatbot.
            </p>

            <p>
              Venturing beyond, I've earned accolades as a Microsoft Certified
              Azure Fundamentals achiever and completed the Northwestern
              University 101: Leading with Analytics and Artificial
              Intelligence. Andrew Ng's revered Deep Learning Specialization
              from DeepLearning.AI fuels my hunger for knowledge.
            </p>

            <p>
              In this ever-evolving landscape, I thrive as an AI/ML
              Practitioner, ceaselessly innovating, solving, and making my mark
              on the frontiers of technology.

              In this research-intensive endeavor, I present a pioneering
              chatbot architecture designed and implemented from the ground up
              using PyTorch. Leveraging state-of-the-art advancements in natural
              language processing (NLP), my project integrates an innovative
              fusion of techniques, including encoder-decoder architecture,
              local and global attention mechanisms, as well as both
              unidirectional and bidirectional encoders. This convergence of
              methodologies aims to enhance the chatbot's contextual
              understanding, fluency, and response coherence.

              Introducing 'Save the Princess,' an innovative game developed
              through Reinforcement Learning (RL). By defining a well-structured
              environment and problem, I crafted a Q-learning framework with
              state transition functions and reward mechanisms. Tuning
              Q-learning parameters and policies, the algorithm demonstrated
              remarkable performance. Experimentation with diverse parameter
              values further enriched the outcomes, both quantitatively and
              qualitatively. To elevate the project, I implemented Deep
              Q-Network (DQN) with two enhancements, justifiably selected from
              the literature, bringing state-of-the-art advancements to the
              game. Additionally, I applied Reinforcement Learning algorithms to
              the Atari Learning Environment, presenting both algorithm
              rationale and results analysis. A comprehensive exploration into
              RL's potential in diverse contexts.

				Exploring the dynamic realm of time series data, I embarked on an ambitious stock price forecasting project. With an intricate dataset encompassing stock histories of 31 diverse companies, I tackled the challenge using advanced techniques.

				Employing a custom data generator in PyTorch, I harnessed the 'Close' column data to predict closing prices. Transforming the problem into supervised learning, I formulated a window of data, enabling the model to learn from historical trends.
				
				I pursued two distinct approaches: an MLP and an LSTM network. The MLP, fortified with Batch Normalization, yielded favorable outcomes after rigorous training. The LSTM network, with 5 layers and 512 hidden cells, emerged as the front-runner, surpassing the MLP in performance.
				
				Throughout the journey, I experimented with sequence lengths, optimizers, and epochs, fine-tuning the models. The LSTM's prowess on test data underscores its potential for accurate stock price forecasting. Future avenues include exploring GRUs, RNNs, and tweaking hyperparameters for even more refined predictions.

				In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting company bankruptcies using an imbalanced dataset. Leveraging a comprehensive case study on a famous bankruptcy dataset, I employed three distinct methods to address the imbalance issue.

				After thorough exploratory data analysis, I adopted a multi-pronged strategy. Using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, and ensemble decision trees, I designed a series of predictive models. In particular, Random Forest showcased exceptional performance, achieving an AUC score of 0.97. I explored various metrics such as precision, F1 score, and AUC, ensuring a balanced perspective.
				
				The outcomes highlighted the significance of robust techniques for bankruptcy prediction, with ensemble methods delivering notable success. While this study presents impressive results, opportunities for future exploration include incorporating textual data using NLP techniques and experimenting with advanced neural network architectures.
